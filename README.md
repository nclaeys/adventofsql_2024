# Advent of SQL 2024

Here is my attempt of solving the Advent of SQL exercices found: https://adventofsql.com/

So far I like it to improve my SQL skills.

## Day17

This day I think the data was wrong. There is an entry for New york timezone which results in no solution possible.
I deleted that entry to find a 1 hour overlapping meeting.

## Day18

This day I struggled with the wording of peers. I initially interpreted as both people at the same level and having the same manager.
Based on the example it however only looked at the level, which is why I only considered that without checking they have the same manager.
For me the wording is ambiguous, not sure what to make from it.

## Day20

Here the instructions are also a bit ambiguous in my opinion. We need to look for the distinct keys in the key-value pairs.
First attempt returned an url which used twice the same key (utm_source) which is why it was not correct.
